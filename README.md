🚀 Smart Reminder App

I recently developed Geominder, a Flutter-based mobile application powered by Firebase as the backend. The app is designed to help users never miss an important task by providing a dual alarm system:

⏰ Time-Based Alarms – Triggers at the exact scheduled time, notifying users with complete task details including title, description, and images.

📍 Location-Based Alarms – Uses background location tracking to trigger alerts when the user enters a defined radius around a selected location, ensuring reminders are context-aware.

🔑 Additional Features:

Secure Login & Signup

Profile Management (edit & update user details)

Real-time synchronization with Firebase


With Geominder, managing tasks becomes smarter and more personalized—whether it’s about being on time or being at the right place.
